I am developing a web app for tracking calories and workouts.

DEVELOPMENT GOALS:

Responsive and snappy, minimalistic UI - cut the bloat.

An intuitive way of organizting workouts.

Initially, I will prioritize the tracking of calories and macro nutrients.

Long term goals include a way to visualize your progress 
over time, and the development of a 'streak' system both 
for completing workouts and maintaing dietary streaks.
